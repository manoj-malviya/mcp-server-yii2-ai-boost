Yii2 AI Boost is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants (like Claude Code) with comprehensive tools and guidelines for faster Yii2 application development.

---

## Features

- **13 MCP Tools** - Database inspection and queries, config access, route analysis, component introspection, model and validation inspection, console command discovery, migration inspection, widget inspection, logging, and guideline search
- **On-Demand Guidelines** - AI searches 36KB of Yii2 best practices only when needed (zero context cost until requested)
- **Framework Guidelines** - Comprehensive Yii2 patterns covering controllers, models, migrations, caching, auth, and more
- **IDE Integration** - Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Zed, and other MCP-compatible editors

---

## Quick Start

For experienced developers:

```bash
# 1. Install stable release
composer require codechap/yii2-ai-boost:^1.1 --dev

# Or install beta (includes model_inspector, validation_rules, console_command_inspector, migration_inspector, widget_inspector)
composer require codechap/yii2-ai-boost:1.2.3-beta.1 --dev

# 2. Run installation
php yii boost/install

# 3. (Optional) Sync guidelines to your editor (Cursor/Zed)
php yii boost/sync-rules
```

That's it! Claude Code and other AI tools now have access to your application context.

---

## Installation

### **Step 1**: Require the Package

```bash
cd /path/to/yii2/application

# Stable release (8 core tools)
composer require codechap/yii2-ai-boost:^1.1 --dev

# Beta release (13 tools - includes model inspector, validation rules, console commands, migration inspector, widget inspector)
composer require codechap/yii2-ai-boost:1.2.3-beta.1 --dev
```

### **Step 2**: Run Installation Wizard

```bash
php yii boost/install
```

The installation runs automatically and:
- Detects your Yii2 environment
- Generates configuration files (`.mcp.json`, `boost.json`)
- Copies framework guidelines to `.ai/guidelines/`

If installation fails, please [open an issue](https://github.com/codechap/yii2-ai-boost/issues) or reach out on [X](https://x.com/codechap).

### **Step 3**: Connect Claude Code and or your IDE

__Claude Code integration__

After running `php yii boost/install`, a `.mcp.json` file will be generated in your project root. Claude Code will automatically detect and use this configuration to connect to the MCP server.

__Codex CLI Configuration__
@todo

__Gemini CLI Configuration__
@todo

__Zed Configuration__

For Zed create or open your settings file in .zed/settings.json

```json
{
    "context_servers": {
      "yii2-ai-boost": {
        "enabled": true,
        "command": "php",
        "args" : [
            "yii", "boost/mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
}
```

### Generated Files

After installation, you'll have:

- **`.mcp.json`** - MCP server configuration for Claude Code
- **`boost.json`** - Package configuration and tool list
- **`.ai/guidelines/`** - Framework and ecosystem guidelines (Markdown)
- **`.cursor/rules/yii2-boost.mdc`** - (Optional) Generated rules for Cursor
- **`.rules`** - (Optional) Generated rules for Zed

---

## Usage

### View Yii2 information

```bash
php yii boost/info
```

Displays:
- Package version and configuration
- List of available MCP tools
- Status of guidelines and configuration files

### Sync Editor Rules

```bash
php yii boost/sync-rules
```

Automatically generates:
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/rules/yii2-boost.mdc`
- **Zed**: `.rules` (in project root)

These files contain the core Yii2 guidelines and structural references, giving your AI editor "X-Ray vision" into Yii2 best practices without manual prompting.

### Start MCP Server (Manual Testing)

```bash
php yii boost/mcp
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: This command is invoked automatically by Cluade Code or your editor. You don't need to run it manually.

The server listens on STDIN for JSON-RPC requests and outputs responses to STDOUT.

### Update Guidelines

```bash
php yii boost/update
```

Copies updated guidelines to the relevant folders.

---

## Guidelines & Editor Integration

Yii2 AI Boost comes with a rich library of "Context Anchors" in `.ai/guidelines/`. These are Markdown files that define exact structures for Yii2 components (Controllers, Models, Migrations, etc.), preventing AI hallucinations.

### 1. Active Search (MCP Tool)
The MCP server includes a `search_guidelines` tool. AI agents (like Claude or Gemini) can use this to "look up" how to do things in Yii2.
*   *User:* "How do I create a migration?"
*   *AI:* Calls `search_guidelines(query="migration")` -> Reads `database/yii-migration.md` -> Writes perfect code.

### 2. Passive Context (Editor Rules)
Run `php yii boost/sync-rules` to bake these guidelines directly into your editor's context.
*   **Cursor**: Creates a `.mdc` rule file.
*   **Zed**: Creates a `.rules` file.

This means when you open a file in Zed or Cursor, the AI *already knows* it should use `yii\web\Controller` and not `Illuminate\Routing\Controller`.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants to interact with tools and data sources. MCP allows Claude Code and other AI tools to securely access your application's context—database schemas, configuration, routes, and logs—without exposing sensitive data.

Yii2 AI Boost implements MCP v2025-11-25 using JSON-RPC 2.0 over STDIO transport. This means Claude Code communicates with your application through standard input/output, with no need for network configuration.

- Discovers widgets from @app/widgets/ directory

## Core Tools Architecture

All 13 tools provide deep introspection into your Yii2 application. They follow a consistent architecture based on the **BaseTool** abstract class, which provides:

- **Automatic Sanitization**: Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, keys) is automatically redacted from all tool outputs
- **Database Discovery**: Tools automatically detect and access configured database connections
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Input parameters are validated against defined schemas
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error responses without exposing sensitive details

### How the Log Inspector Works

The Log Inspector features a **multi-reader architecture** supporting three log storage methods:

| Reader | Source | Best For | Features |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| **InMemoryLogReader** | Current request logs (`Yii::getLogger()->messages`) | Real-time debugging during development | Full stack traces, microsecond timestamps |
| **FileLogReader** | FileTarget text logs (`@runtime/logs/app.log`) | Reviewing logs from previous requests/sessions | Efficient file handling (5MB+ files), auto-detects rotation |
| **DbLogReader** | DbTarget database table (`{{%log}}`) | Production logging & log aggregation | Fast indexed queries, precise time-range filtering |

## MCP Protocol

Yii2 AI Boost implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) v2025-11-25:

- **Transport**: STDIO (local) - reads from stdin, writes to stdout
- **Format**: JSON-RPC 2.0
- **Tools**: Expose functionality to AI assistants
- **Resources**: Provide static content (guidelines, configuration)

### Example JSON-RPC Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "application_info",
    "arguments": {
      "include": ["version", "environment", "modules"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "version": {
      "yii2_version": "2.0.45",
      "php_version": "8.1.2",
      "php_sapi": "cli"
    },
    "environment": {
      "yii_env": "dev",
      "yii_debug": true,
      "base_path": "/path/to/app",
      "runtime_path": "/path/to/app/runtime"
    },
    "modules": {
      "site": {
        "class": "app\\modules\\site\\Module",
        "basePath": "/path/to/app/modules/site"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response Structure**:
- `jsonrpc`: Always `"2.0"` per JSON-RPC spec
- `id`: Echoes the request ID for request/response matching
- `result`: The actual tool output (sensitive data automatically redacted)

**Error Responses** use `error` instead of `result`:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32603,
    "message": "Internal error",
    "data": "Error details here"
  }
}
```

## Guidelines

The package downloads comprehensive Yii2 development guidelines to `.ai/guidelines/core/yii2-2.0.45.md`. These cover application structure, controllers, models, views, components, security, performance, and console commands.

### Including Guidelines in Your AI Workflow

To use these guidelines with Claude Code or other AI tools, add the following lines to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file:

```markdown
@include .ai/guidelines/core/yii2-2.0.45.md
```

Your AI assistant can also search additional guidelines on-demand via the `search_guidelines` MCP tool (database, cache, auth, validation, etc.).

This ensures AI assistants have access to framework best practices and patterns when working in your project.

## Requirements

| Component | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **PHP** | 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 | ✓ Tested |
| **Yii2** | 2.0.45+ | ✓ Compatible |

**Why PHP 7.4?** While PHP 7.4 is EOL, Yii2 itself still supports it. As a Yii2 extension, we maintain the same baseline to ensure developers on older Yii2 installations aren't locked out. If your Yii2 app runs, this tool should too.

**Why no caching?** All introspection data is fetched fresh on every request. This is intentional - as a development tool, you need to see the current state of your application, not stale cached data. When you change a route, schema, or component, the tools should reflect that immediately.

**Note**: PHP 8.4 support pending. Report any compatibility issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/codechap/yii2-ai-boost/issues).

## Development Timeline

| Phase | Goal | Status | Tools |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| **1** | Core MVP | ✓ Complete | 8 tools + guidelines + installer   |
| **2** | Model & Command Introspection | ✓ Complete | +3 tools (model inspector, validation rules, console commands) |
| **3** | Extended Tools | In Progress | +2 tools (migration inspector, widget inspector); asset, performance planned |
| **4** | Advanced Features | Planned | Behavior/event/cache inspection, semantic search |
